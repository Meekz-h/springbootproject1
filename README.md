# This is a Spring boot Java project modeling a gaming mouse sales shop. 
# It utilizes a customized Spring Framework application with an HTML front-end and a Java backend. 
# The program preloads a sample inventory of gaming mice that the user can use to purchase said products. 
# They can add customize in/outsourced parts (mice skates) and the application will update inventory and warn users if there is a low amount of stock.
